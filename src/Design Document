EquationRunner.java
    1. Welcome the user and prompt them to input their first pair of coordinates, specifying the format (x,y) where x and y are both integers
    2. Scan the next line as a String with scanner and get both coordinates store as (x1, y1)
    3. Ask for the second pair of coordinates store as (x2, y2)
    3. Create a LinearEquation object with the coordinates
    4. Using the toString() method, print out the:
            two original points; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
            equation of the line in y = mx + b format (m as a fraction if necessary, b as a double)
            slope of the line
            y-intercept of the line
            distance between the two points (Nearest hundredths)
    5. Prompt the user to input any x value as a double
    6. Scan the next line using next.double
    7. print the y coordinate for the x value scanned in line 6

LinearEquation Class

Instance Variables:
    private int x - represents the x coordinate
    private int y - represents the y coordinate
    private int slope - represents the slope of the equation


Constructor
    public LinearEquation(double x)

Methods

    public slope(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)
        create equation to find slope using rise over run
        store slope as variable double

    public yIntercept(int y, int x, double slope)
        calculate y intercept by substituting and solving for b store as double

    public createEquation(double slope, double yIntercept)
        return String creating y = mx + b format equation

    public distance(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)
        calculate the distance between the two points using the distance formula store as double

    public thirdPoint(double x)
        takes user input for another point on the line and returns the y coordinate for the point as (x, y)

    public toString()
        prints:
        two original points; (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
        equation of the line in y = mx + b format (m as a fraction if necessary, b as a double)
        slope of the line
        y-intercept of the line
        distance between the two points (Nearest hundredths)
